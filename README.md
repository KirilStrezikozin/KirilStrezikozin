<b>Kiril Strezikozin, artist and coder</b>

3d Arts, Animations, Design, Development<br> - these are the things I love.

Throughout my life journey, I found out that nothing<br>
stops or deflects me from reaching my aims.<br>
Whatever it takes, there is only one sun ahead - the future me.

You might not realize that the power of all our actions comes from the inner energy.<br>
And that energy follows every path I choose. I can create it.<br>

I won regional IT Olimpiads
