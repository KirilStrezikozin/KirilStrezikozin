Kiril Strezikozin, artsit.

I make 3d arts that represent my inner thoughts and mental states.
I use software like blender, unreal engine, otoy octane, quixel mixer and bridge, photoshop and davinci resolve.
I focus on details and surrealism, as well as image nature and inside ideas.

It's always good to work with people who think the same way you do. 

I create what I feel, what I feel creates me.
I never see a dream as a destination point, I see it as an opportunity to get better.
